- Hope

# 1st Round
## Warriors Sux vs. TheDimePassers
### Date: January 25th, 2018
Even Lebron had more help when he faced the Spurs in the 2007 NBA Finals. Expect this to be a strenuous journey to the Finals. Expect injury from Fortman as he will be carrying the team on his back. The one bright light in the Sux roster is the length of their playesr. With all players above 6 foot, expect this team to create matchup nightmares. Even so, expect their offense to purely go through Fortman. Look for Team 1's offense to go through the pick and roll combination of Hazi and Andoji. Both will create matchup nightmares of their own, as Warriors Sux possess no true center.

**Harrison's Prediction: Warriors Sux 21-20 **

## Oron Sux vs. Lakers
### Date: TBD
