# Chobe Shines

The DimePassers shocked the world, proving that size doesn't matter. Andoji led the game in points, assists, and rebounds, making him the Kia MVP of the night. While Andoji started slow, pace quickly sped up, as he eventually went to go on to score the final 4 points of the game. The Warriors Sux attempted to put different players on Andoji, but to no avail, the game was a blowout from the beginning.

# Sidd Steals the Show

A surprising bright light in the abysmal Sux defense was Siddharth Sharma, who led the game in steals with 4. While he put up no shots himself, he was able to crowd the passing lanes with his lanky frame and stern demeanor.

# A New Hope

Hope and Andoji were a spectacle to see, showing what a composed offense can do. Hope scored all 5 of his points on offensive rebounds and assists from Andoji. Even with surprise meetings and backlog refinements, nothing could stop Hope. He had an appointment. *With the rim.*

# Fortman Flops

Although with a valiant effort from Fortman (scoring the Warriors Sux's 4 of 5 points), it was a poor showing as he only got those points on a 29% shooting night. He can't be too faulted though, as the defense was able to smother Fortman into making tough and difficult shots and his teammates unable to bail him out when given the opportunity to shoot.

# Draymond Dame Defense
Despite Larson being severely undersized, Damian was able to hold Hazi to 0 points, not even allowing him to attempt a single shot. Oron only had one stat of the night, providing a single assist. Look for Larson to continue being a defensive threat, as he continues to polish his offensive game (1 point).

# Final Score: 15 - 5 DimePassers
