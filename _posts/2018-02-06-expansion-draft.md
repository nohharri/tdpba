You read that right folks, after a phenomenal zero-game inaugural season, the TDPBA is expanding. Commissioner Harrison Noh announced on Monday that the TDPBA will be adding two new teams to the Plano campus, as well as doubling the league's player pool. Since the league has grown extremely rapidly since the initial draft, Commissioner Noh has determined that there will be a full re-draft of every player in the TDPBA.

That's right.

# Entire.

# Redraft.

The two current teams, Where's Warren and the Schweddy Bois, will be disbanded with overall records of 0-0 and 0-0 (respectively), and they will be rebranded along with the initial branding of the two new expansion teams. Commissioner Noh, in an attempt to evenly spread out the talent of the new and improved league, also announced the four new captain/general managers, and they are listed as follows.

# Team Captains:

## Ian "Ian" Kwan
### <span style="color: #bf5700">University of Texas - Austin</span>

## Anurag "Cho" Andoji
### <span style="color: #bf5700">University of Texas - Austin</span>

## Michael "Mike" Fortman
### <span style="color: #c5050c">University of Wisconsin</span>

## Brian "Brian" Yeh
### <span style="color: #bf5700">University of Texas - Austin</span>

These four captains will be drafting LIVE on February 6, 2018 at 2PM.


The draft will follow a snake format, meaning that the last pick in the first round will get the first pick in the second round, which will repeat until all 16 league members are drafted. Listed below are the 16 eligible draftees, all of whom are excited to show off their skills on the hardwood.

# Eligible Draftees (in no particular order, except alphabetical by first name):

## Andrew Enenmoh - C
### <span style="color: #bf5700">University of Texas - Austin</span>

## Andrew Lee - G
### <span style="color: #3284BF">UCLA</span>
Lee has recently purchased his first basketball 28 years into his adult life. While he does have a newfound passion for the game, consider him a late 10 - 16th pick. 

## Chris Young - F
### <span style="color: #0021A5">University of Florida</span>

## Damian Larson - G/F
### <span style="color: #0021A5">University of Florida</span>

## Hope Atina - G/F
### <span style="color: #002469">Rice University</span>

## Jaiden Gerig - G
### <span style="color: #500000">Texas A&M University</span>

## Jeffrey Lin - G/F
### <span style="color: #bb0000">The Ohio State University</span>

## Justin Katz - C
### <span style="color: #500000">Texas A&M University</span>

## Kush Patel - G
### <span style="color: #bf5700">University of Texas - Austin</span>

## Oron Hazi - C
### <span style="color: #500000">Texas A&M University</span>

## Reece Boyd - F
### <span style="color: #0066cc">Middle Tennessee State University</span>
Reece is an actual D1 athlete for swimming, so there's that. Not much is known about his basketball ability, but come on. D1. Athlete.

## Sasa Cocic - F
### <span style="color: #C8102E">Iowa State University</span>

## Siddharth Sharma - F
### <span style="color: #CC0033">University of Arizona</span>
While possessing a lanky demeanor, Sharma lacks the basic basketball IQ necessary at the TDPBA level. He will average around 3 steals a game throughout the season, but don't expect much offensive output during the season. Consider him a mid-round pickup if you have any holes at the forward position.

## Thomas Doan - G/F
### <span style="color: #bf5700">University of Texas - Austin</span>

## Thomas Huerta - F
### <span style="color: #841617">University of Oklahoma</span>
Little to nothing is known about this mysterious forward. While he played varsity basketball in high school and possesses a large and tall frame, Huerta has spent the majority of his free time in the weight room. He should be an early pickup, maybe even first overall, as he possesses the physical gifts such as Giannis or Lebron.

## Warren Crasta - G
### <span style="color: #bf5700">University of Texas - Austin</span>
It's Warren.


Best of luck to the new captains in the draft, and best of luck to all the teams in the upcoming season. It's going to be the best one yet--mainly because it has to be.
