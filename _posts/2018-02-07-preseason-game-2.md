# Huerta Hustles....For the First Half

Buff Thomas was a force to be reckoned with for the first half of this game 2. Huerta scored 5 of his 6 points in the first 10 minutes, showing what an athletic 6 foot forward could do. Sasa was unable to stop Huerta, as he was able to get to the rim with ease. But unconditioned for basketball, he was easily gassed and unable to provide much offensive output.

# Chris with the Miss

While Chris provided a solid scoring night, he did it with little to no efficiency. Young shot an abysmal 25% while only hitting 2 of his outside shots. Young was obviously in a slump. Whether or not he can show he can score consistently has yet to be seen, but with only one preseason game left, whether he can justify his first round pick status proves to be a mystery.

# Cocic or Jokic?

Cocic-Banjanac was the clear winner for KIA MVP as he led both team in both scoring output and rebounds, scoring this season's **FIRST DOUBLE DOUBLE,** recording 10 points and 11 rebounds. Cocic proved that he will not be suffering the wear and tear of the regular season, as he played efficiently and passionately throughout the game. He takes my ballot for the regular season MVP, as he single-handedly brought his team back from a **10 - 0** deficit. If Sasa is paired with another teammate with more offensive game, expect his team to be a contender.

# Just-in Time

Sasa threatened Oron Sux late, but Justin Katz was able to push his team towards victory by contributing on both ends, getting 2 blocks and 2 steals while contributing 5 points. While Katz showed early comparisons to Shaq, it was clear that he belongs in the same conversation as Dirk, scoring two late threes to bring his team back into the cluthces of victory. After the score was brought back up from 10-0 to 10-10, Katz scored the final two points of the game.


# Final Score: 16 - 14 Oron Sux
