# Cho Shines Again
Fellow BuffBaller teammates Thomas Huerta and Anurag Andoji faced off against one another after Huerta was traded from Klutchtime. Andoji seemed to take this rivalry to heart as he wen dt off to score 10 points. Huerta and Young both began the game off with a three, but those proved to be the bulk of the scoring for the night. Huerta lost energy quickly in the first, "Lebron'ing" in the finals. 

# Groundhog Day

History seems to repeat itself, as the Dimepassers once again, were able to hold their opponents to only 5 points. This comes behind the defensive efforts of Hope and Hazi. While Hazi doesn't portray himself as scoring threat, he is more than capable of locking his opponent down, holding Katz to only 1 point.

# MVP - Preseason Tournament

Anurag Andoji was the clear MVP for this preseason tournament. Look for him to continue being a threat for the BuffBallerBrand as he presents himself as a slashing threat while knocking down silky smooth threes from the logo.

# Final Score: 15 - 5 Oron Sux
