# Week 1 - Free Agency Stars shine, Starters Blow

Defense was the name of the game for these two conference powerhouses, as both teams held each other to abysmal shooting nights. Patel talked big and backed it up, as he led his team to a 21-15 victory over the Swaggy TDPs. When it came to klutchtime, Patel delivered. 

Young posted another poor shooting night, shooting below his already low preseason average. As a former second round pick, he has a lot to prove before he can save anyone. But I believe he can save the world.

# Free Agency

Free agency proved hectic as 3 last minute additions were added to the rosters. They collectively led their teams in scoring, assists, and rebounds.

# Defensive Presence

Katz was the only bright light in the SwaggyTDPs' abysmal play as he recorded 2 blocks in only 20 minutes of play. Unfortunately, Katz will be returning to his team as he will be traded back to Where's Warren.
